# Hyperparameter grid for TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
# C: Inverse of regularization strength (controls overfitting).
#   - Lower C (e.g., 0.1): Stronger regularization, simpler model, less overfitting.
#   - Higher C (e.g., 10.0): Weaker regularization, more complex model, risks overfitting.
#   - Default: 1.0. Tune based on data size and noise.
# max_iter: Maximum iterations for solver convergence.
#   - Increase (e.g., to 2000) if you see convergence warnings.
#   - Default: 1000. Higher values ensure better fit but take longer.
C: [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
max_iter: [1000, 2000]
